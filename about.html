<div id="about_03"><p><h10>Stage 1</h10></p> 
<p><h8>Initial meeting</h8></p>
<p><h8>Preparation and Brief</h8></p>

The design process begins with a meeting at your property. We will listen to your ideas and expectations and help you define a brief. A variety of design ideas will be put forward, including organisation of spaces, qualities of natural light and material finishes. We will help clarify your intentions and discuss alternative approaches
for your project. We will perform an architectural survey on your property so we
can have a rigorous base of drawings to work with and will also assess any soil or structural investigations required. This stage includes advising on the need for other consultants, from structural engineers to home automation specialists. Your budget will be discussed and agreed. We will provide outline construction cost information based on current prices per square metre for comparable projects in your area. A programme will be produced alongside the payment schedule that describes the sequence and approximate duration of each element of the design and construction works until completion on site. This is a comprehensive timeline that allows you to fully understand and organise your investment. </div>

<div id="about_04"><p><h10>Stage 2</h10></p> 
<p><h8>Design Process</h8></p>
<p><h8>Planning Application</h8></p>


We believe in a collaborative design process and we will discuss each aspect of the proposal in detail with you as the design develops. Weekly meetings will take place during this stage as we provide you with drawings, material samples, virtual and physical models that illustrate the qualities of your project and enable you to clearly envisage ideas. When the project reaches the desired objectives an application will be prepared for planning consents from your local council. Plans, elevations and sections will be submitted alongside a design and access statement. For smaller projects there is usually an eight week determination period, in which time the planners will consult with neighbours and relevant bodies. Other consents may be required, depending
on the scope of the project. At this stage a quantity surveyor may be appointed
to produce a detailed cost estimate of the scheme prior to submitting a planning application. This will ensure that the project is on budget. The cost report provides a detailed shopping list of all items in the project, allowing informed decisions to be made if savings are required on specific items. </div>

<div id="about_05"><p><h10>Stage 3</h10></p> 
<p><h8>Detailed Drawings</h8></p>
<p><h8>Builder Pricing</h8></p>


At this stage we will have full planning consent from the local authorities. We can progress the design from planning drawings to a fully developed proposal, with detailed drawings and schedules describing the works. These form part of a package that will enable exact prices to be provided for construction. A building regulations package including detailed drawings and notes are submitted to an approved inspector who will certify compliance with the building regulations. We will advise
on the selection of an appropriate building contract for the works, and explain the process of entering into a building contract and the duties of the client, the architect and the contractor at each stage. Tender documents will be prepared to supply to contractors for pricing. These will include a schedule of works, detailed demolition and construction drawings. Contractors will be invited to tender, allowing a period of 4 weeks for contractors to review the documents and return completed tender submissions with a lump sum price and a total contract duration in weeks. We will advise on the selection of the best contractor. </div>

<div id="about_06"><p><h10>Stage 4</h10></p> 
<p><h8>Building Contract </h8></p>
<p><h8>Construction starts on site</h8></p>


A pre-contract meeting will be arranged with the selected contractor/builder to discuss the project in detail and to present the building contract for signatures. Once all parts are in agreement a full set of construction drawings will be issued to the contractor and work will begin on site. We will deal with all queries and deliver formal Architect’s Instructions to the contractor. At regular intervals we will visit site to inspect all work, to ensure that it is completed to the required standard. Once this is agreed, we will certify the work completed and the sums due to the contractor.
A 5% sum is typically retained until the end of the project. The architect’s practical completion certificate transfers possession of the building to the client. At this
stage the rectification period will begin. This is typically a 6 month period in which
the contractor is instructed to return to rectify any relevant issues. Once the final certificate is issued at the end of this period the remaining retention sum is paid to the contractor. </div>
